# Color Detection and Tracking using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time color detection and tracking using OpenCV in Python. It captures video from a webcam and tracks objects of a specific color by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Features
- Real-time color detection from webcam feed.
- Tracking of a specified color by drawing bounding rectangles around the detected object.
- Noise removal using morphological operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Color-Detection-and-Tracking.git
cd Color-Detection-and-Tracking

2. Installation the dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the script:
bash

python color_detection_tracking.py

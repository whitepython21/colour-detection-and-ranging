# Color Detection and Tracking using OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time color detection and tracking using OpenCV in Python. It captures video from a webcam and tracks objects of a specific color by drawing bounding boxes around them.

## Features
- Real-time color detection from webcam feed.
- Tracking of a specified color by drawing bounding rectangles around the detected object.
- Noise removal using morphological operations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Color-Detection-and-Tracking.git
cd Color-Detection-and-Tracking

2. Installation the dependencies:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the script:
bash

python color_detection_tracking.py

4.Create `.gitignore`:
   Use the following `.gitignore` file to ignore unnecessary files:

```bash
# Python-specific
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# Virtual environments
venv/
env/

# Jupyter Notebook checkpoints
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# VSCode settings
.vscode/

5. Push to GitHub:

i.Initialize the local repository:
git init

ii.Add the files:
git add .

iii.Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Initial commit: Color Detection and Tracking project"

iv.Add the remote repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/Color-Detection-and-Tracking.git
